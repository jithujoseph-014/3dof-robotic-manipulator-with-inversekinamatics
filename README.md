# 3dof-robotic-manipulator-with-inversekinamatics

3 dof robotic arm who's end point can be placed in any position in 3d Cartesian space 
(ie in any x,y,z coordinates) within its workspace using inverse kinematics.
The inverse kinematics was solved by using a geometric approach. which is much simpler
for beginners when compared to dh-algorithm. But it is way less practice
and can be used for education purpose to get a better understanding of what inverse and
forward kinematics is and their uses .
